# Color-Generator
The project is a color generator that has been built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The webpage features a color generator that allows users to generate a random color by clicking on a button. The hex code of the color is displayed on the page, allowing the user to use the generated color for their design needs. The HTML and CSS have been used to create a clean and visually appealing interface, with a button that triggers the color generation. The JavaScript code handles the color generation functionality, generating a new hex code every time the button is clicked. This project demonstrates how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be used together to create a simple but useful tool that designers and developers can use to quickly generate a color scheme for their projects.

On clicking the button a random color will be shown on the page each time.
